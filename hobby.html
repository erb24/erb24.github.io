<p>I currently compete for the <a href=https://www.grcrunning.com/eric-beyerle/>Georgetown Running Club</a> located in Washington, D.C and <a href=sparta.dk/>Sparta Team R</a> based in Copenhagen, Denmark. I previously competed for the <a href=https://www.uorunning.com>University of Oregon club team</a> from 2015 to 2021 and competed collegiately for <a href=https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/3736586/Centre/Eric_Beyerle>Centre College</a> at the NCAA DIII level </p>
<p>Most of my training from college is available on my <a href="https://running2win.com/">Running2Win profile</a> (you will need to create an account to access). Training from 2019 to present is available on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/35718086">Strava</a>, for the most part. I'll try to move my log to this page in the near future (typed out 28 April 2024; the move will likely coincide with the expiration of my postdoctoral contract at the University of Maryland, College Park on 31 August 2024).</p>

<h2> December 2024</h2>

	<li> I finished in 145th place (34:54 for 10k) at the <a href="https://www.rtspt.com/events/usatf/clubxc24/m_open_team.HTML">USATF Club XC Championships</a> outside Tacoma, WA in what is likely my final race for the Georgetown Running Club. </li>

<h2> November 2024</h2>
<ol>
	<li> I DNF'd at the Danish national XC championships in Odense...don't take your Vaporflys to a spike fight! </li>
</ol>
<h2> October 2024</h2>
<ol>
	<li> I placed 14th in the <a href=https://meets.rosterathletics.com/public/competitions/details/results?id=25849&meId=238722#title-anchor/>first round of the Craft Løbe Cup</a> at Kastrup Strandparken in Copenhagen, running a 24:04 for ~7.2km. </li>

<h2> June 2024</h2>
<ol>
<li> I had a PRP injection performed at the insertion of my left Achilles tendon on 6 June 2024 after a diagnosis of a low-grade, partial, longitudinal tear from the insertion of the tendon to the midsubstance. The optimistic timeline for a return to running is 6 weeks, although, given the 3+ year history of this injury, and since the origins (chronic or acute?) are still unknown, I expect, unfortunately, it could be a while before everything is fully sorted.</li>
