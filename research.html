<h2>Conformational Dynamics of a Single-Stranded DNA Dinucleotide</h2>
<p> As another application of MSMs to biological systems, we performed long (1 microsecond) simulations of deoxyadenosine dinucleotide (dApdA) in aqueous solution of varying NaCl concentration. The free-energy landscape of the dApdA molecule projected in the two-dimensional space of the radial separation between the nucleobases and the twist angle around this axis was used to as the reduced state space for construction of an MSM that was subsequently coarse-grained using the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379504004689">robust Perron cluster-cluster analysis (PCCA+)</a> method. The coarse grained transition matrix dedscribing the conditional transition probabilites among these coarse-grained macrostates was used to interpret the unstacking mechanism as well as its associated timescale. We find that each macrostate defines a physically relevant set of conformations, e.g. right-handed structures, left-handed structures, unstacked, stacked and achiral. The structural statistics in each macrostate was combined with <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/j100721a038">Schellman's matrix method</a> to calculate the circular dichroism (CD) spectra for each macrostate. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/4/1872/6121468">We found</a> that, in agreement with prior conjectures, that the CD spectrum is due almost exclusively to a linear combination of two states. However, in contrast to that conjecture, we found that the CD spewctrum is due mostly to the predominant left- and right-handed states, not a right-handed and unstacked state. Using the average CD from this state gave very similar results to using just the average structure from each macrostate. Thus, we provided a computationally convenient method to extract the relevant metastable states, a determination of how the conformational diversity of dApdA contributes to its CD spectrum, and postulate a mechanism, including the associated kinetics, for the unstacking transition of this simple nucleic acid system.<br><br>

Outlined and labeled are the five macrostates found through PCCA+ on the trajectory. The right-handed, B-DNA conformation is highlighted with a white box, and the heavy-populated achiral state minimum is highlighted with a red box. d) Structures sampled from the simulation with the lowest heavy-atom root-mean-squared displacement to the average structure of the indicated macrostate. Although not shown, only calculating the CD using these structures is sufficient to give a good estimation of the CD spectrum found using the statistics from the entire MD trajectory.</figcaption>

<h2>Machine Learning and Rare Events</h2>
Currently, I am a postdoctoral associate in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pratyushtiwary/">Pratyush Tiwary's lab</a> at the University of Maryland. While here, my research has focused mainly on two fairly disparate topics: developing a rough version of energy-entropy disentanglement in a low-dimensional latent space discovered through a generative machine learning technique called the <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0038198">state predictive information bottleneck (SPIB) </a> and using this SPIB method to find good reaction coordinates (RCs) for the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2216099120">nucleation of organic molecules from aqueous solution</a>. To our knowledge, the biased simulations analyzed in this work are the first to sample nucleation of glycine monomers from solution without the use of seeded MD approaches.

<p>While I have studied some nucleation phenomena while at UMD, my focus to date has been on calculating the thermodynamic profiles of RCs learned using the SPIB approach. One of my recent projects has focused on determining good RCs for the unbinding of two model hydrophobic ligands, a united-atom methane particle and a C60 buckyball fullerene, from rigid, hydrophobic pockets. From this analysis, we confirm that a thermodynamically-optimized, one-dimensional RC for the unbinding for both the methane and buckyball involves surmounting an entropy barrier to unbind, with energetic considerations playing a minor role. Furthermore, we find that solute wetness is the main driver of methane dissociation while pocket wetness plays a major role for the buckyball system until the transition state, after which solute wetness dominates the RC. These observations should yield transferable knowledge to the important features describing ligand unbinding in more complication and physiologically relevant systems, such as drug-protein interactions. This study is published in the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c08304"><em>Journal of Physical Chemistry B</em></a>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03819">A preprint is available on the arXiv.</a>
